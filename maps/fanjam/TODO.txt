// ---- Story
- KEY STORY TELLING METHOD: Never explain anything, let the player come up with their own conclusions

// ---- THE TEST ENVIRONEMNT
- The player wakes up in a scanchair (suddenly with no build up - imagine if you were suddenly recusitated, its like a blink)
- They do not know why they are there, but they've been summoned for a reason
- Turn on the power burn a person alive idea
- There is a survey on a terminal (ask creepy and strange questions)
- SURVEY:
	Question X: Little Timmy has toy you want. But you can't convince him to share it with you, what do you do?
		A: Make it seem like an accident - "Did someone turn on the grill?"
		B: Be diplomatic - make a trade.
		C: Spit in his face, and snatch it from his sausage fingers right in front of him.
		D: Just kill him already!

- Outside, the player finds a grave under a tree (encinuate its Simon's grave)

// ---- The Bunker
- Maybe import some rebirth assets to make this environment as rich as possible
- Ceramic AND/OR plaster walls

- Use 03_03_elevator_fuse_box.ent with 03_03_elevator_fuse_box_rod.ent to turn on the power in the bunker
- The player can click on the phone (it's got no unread messages - this room has heavy reverb)
- The door leading outside is high level tech to protect the bunker from the outside
- The doorway is inside a tiny mole hill - like those old graves, or old fashoned storage basements
- 1. Lick it.
  2. Don't lick it.
  3. Lick it, but only a little.

// ---- Outside
- On a clearing in a forest OR in the middle of a never ending field, with a lone oak tree?

- The opening is like a sterotypical rooftop doorway on an apartment complex in New York (think gta 4) - the opening (out of concrete) sticks out of the ground (OR JUST USE A HATCH)
- The player finds a path leading deeper into the forest from the clearing 
- As the player approaches the coast they can hear seagulls
- There is a final terminal
	"Congratulations! [...] "
- There is a crashed plane on the beach
- They eventually find a lone tree at the edge of the cliff, with a grave in it's shadow
- There is a bench, the player will sit on it and listen to nature's sounds - INCREASE THE SOUND OF THE BACKGROUND (to put it into focus in a beautiful way - now, you are really listening)
- Look at player hand anim during Ashley dream
- Fade out
// ROLL CREDITS
// - "We made it Simon[...]" (The same line used when in space?) OR the line where Catherine talks about popping in and out (Delta? Theta? Delta I think)
// Only text: "Made by: Lucas Pettersson"
// - "Eternity among the stars"
// - !END!

// ---- Ideas
- A puppet is sitting 
- The player looks at a camera of the puppet approaching a door and opening it
- The door behind the player opens (light from behind the door lights up the terminal and stuff, making the player think the monster is behind him)
- But there is nothing there (GET TROLLED)
- The camera fottage on the terminal repeats like fake fottage/old fottage
- Now the player can leave
- The monster enters the players safe space - surprising the player
- Place an aquarium somewhere (use particle oil_underwater_smoky.ps for leaking oil spill)
- (easter egg) an image of Munshi smiling (the meme) - "Recovering image file" in a terminal

- When the player has finished OR escaped the experiment, they find a modern (Toronto aesthetic) bunker outside the test environment
- This is the path outside: TEST ENV --> CAVE --> BUNKER --> OUTSIDE
- The player finds old skeleton(s)
- The player finds open the hatch and outside is the wilderness (it's a post apocalyptic world so everything remaining from the modern times is overgrown with vines)

// --- ENDING SCREEN
// - Use cinematic shots with DoF - shots of swaying grass and close up of rocks and such (the sound of the beach in the background with the wind)
// - Fade in Vinland Saga ost like piano
// - Close up shots of the boat (05_02_boat.ent) swaying in the water
// - Catherine's distant voice, maybe children squealing and laughing
// - Shot of the waves
// - Screen starts to glitch out
// - Use particles from levels/05_02 for the beach water waves, clouds, and fog.

// - The final shot from below (ground) looking up at grave - swaying grass (sun shining straight on)
// - Use the tombstone grave_marie.ent to encinuate that Simon is dead (place pictures on his grave, a bouqet of flowers, and Simon's camera)
// - Import rebirth assets perhaps?
// - Fade out
// - "We made it Simon[...]" (The same line used when in space?)
// ROLL CREDITS
// Only text: "Made by: Lucas Pettersson"
// - "Eternity among the stars"
// - !END!
