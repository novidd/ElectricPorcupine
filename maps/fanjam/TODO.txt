// ---- Story
- KEY STORY TELLING METHOD: Never explain anything, let the player come up with their own conclusions

// ---- Events
- The player wakes up in a scanchair
- They do not know why they are there, but they've been summoned for a reason
- Turn on the power burn a person alive idea
- There is a survey on a terminal (ask creepy and strange questions)

- Outside, the player finds a grave under a tree (encinuate its Simon's grave)

// ---- Ideas
- A puppet is sitting 
- The player looks at a camera of the puppet approaching a door and opening it
- The door behind the player opens (light from behind the door lights up the terminal and stuff, making the player think the monster is behind him)
- But there is nothing there (GET TROLLED)
- The camera fottage on the terminal repeats like fake fottage/old fottage
- Now the player can leave
- The monster enters the players safe space - surprising the player

- When the player has finished OR escaped the experiment, they find a modern (Toronto aesthetic) bunker outside the test environment
- This is the path outside: TEST ENV --> CAVE --> BUNKER --> OUTSIDE
- The player finds old skeleton(s)
- The player finds open the hatch and outside is the wilderness (it's a post apocalyptic world so everything remaining from the modern times is overgrown with vines)
