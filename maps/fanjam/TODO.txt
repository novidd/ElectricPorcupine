// ---- Events
- The player wakes up in a scanchair
- They do not know why they are there, but they've been summoned for a reason
- Turn on the power burn a person alive idea

// ---- Ideas
- A puppet is sitting 
- The player looks at a camera of the puppet approaching a door and opening it - the door is behind the player (HA GOTEM!)
- The monster enters the players safe space - surprising the player

- When the player has finished OR escaped the experiment, they find a modern (Toronto aesthetic) bunker outside the test environment
- This is the path outside: TEST ENV --> CAVE --> BUNKER --> OUTSIDE
- The player finds old skeleton(s)
- The player finds open the hatch and outside is the wilderness (it's a post apocalyptic world so everything remaining from the modern times is overgrown with vines)
