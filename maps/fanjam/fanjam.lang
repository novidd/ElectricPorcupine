        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_1_002_interviewee_1_001">At first I couldn&apos;t really see the point of it, but then I thought why shouldn&apos;t we, right? </Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_1_002_interviewee_1_002">I mean, if we are able to save even just a small piece of ourselves, why wouldn&apos;t we do that?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_1_004_catherineterminal_001">So you are in favor then?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_1_005_interviewee_1_001">I think it&apos;s really important we do this. </Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_2_001_catherineterminal_001">What are your thoughts on the ARK?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_2_002_interviewee_2_001">It&apos;s a great idea. Finally we have something do, am I right?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_2_004_catherineterminal_001">Are you optimistic about the project&apos;s chances of... um, about... the ARK reaching space?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_2_005_interviewee_2_001">It can definitely be done. You already solved the biggest problem -- how to actually get us all in there.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_2_005_interviewee_2_002">Now all we have to do is build the damn thing and hope Phi is still operational.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_2_005_interviewee_2_003">Yeah, I think we can do it, but it&apos;s not going to be easy.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_3_001_catherineterminal_001">What are your thoughts on the ARK project?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_3_002_interviewee_3_001">The idea is just incredible, by every definition. It really makes you think about what it means to be human.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_3_004_catherineterminal_001">What makes you say that?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_3_005_interviewee_3_001">Beyond the basics, beyond the superficial, I&apos;m convinced there&apos;s something with even greater value.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_3_005_interviewee_3_002">You have provided a platform, which is not necessarily restricted to our digital progeny, but a means of actual survival.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="terminal_terminal_interviewrecording_3_007_interviewee_3_001">It&apos;s my sincerest belief that we can go on living through the reality of continuity.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_allclear_extra_1_005_catherinerobot_001">Hello, are you hearing this? I&apos;m over here.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_comeseemehurt_001_catherinerobot_001">Ah shit. Simon, you idiot. I was really hoping you wouldn&apos;t set off another burst.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_comeseemehurt_006_catherinerobot_001">Could you hurry up?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_interacttalk_1_001_player_001">No, not you too. I was really hoping you were human.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_interacttalk_1_002_catherinerobot_001">Don&apos;t let the circuitry fool you. I was human once.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_interacttalk_1_017_catherinerobot_001">Before you do anything hasty. Could you help me with something?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_interacttalk_1_018_player_001">What?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_interacttalk_1_019_catherinerobot_001">I was trying to find out what happened with my project when that brute knocked me to the ground.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_interacttalk_1_020_player_001">Your project? How could anything possibly matter when you know you&apos;re a stupid robot in a stupid dead world?!</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_interacttalk_1_021_catherinerobot_001">Okay, focus. I need you to fix me, so I can get back to work. Then you can sulk as much as you want.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_interacttalk_1_022_player_001">You got to be kidding, right? I think I have a better chance of building myself a time machine than of putting you back together.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_beforepopchip_2_001_catherinerobot_001">Should be easy enough. Just pick up the chip and slide it into the omnitool.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_beforepopchip_2_002_player_001">Why does a robot chip fit a door opener?</Entry>

        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_beforepopchip_2_004_player_001">Uh, Catherine? All right, let&apos;s give this a try.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_whileomnittoolisputin_001_catherinerobot_001">When the omnitool has loaded, just plug my cortex chip into the tool.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_whileomnittoolisputin_002_player_001">What&apos;s a cortex chip?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_whileomnittoolisputin_003_catherinerobot_001">It will be obvious. I&apos;ll eject it for you. Just grab the chip and slide it into the omnitool. Come on, I just need you to do this one thing for me.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_whileomnittoolisputin_004_player_001">Sure, whatever.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_001_catherineomnitool_001">--ectors, pretty much anything will fit.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_001_catherineomnitool_002">Oh, this feels weird.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_001_catherineomnitool_003">I&apos;m in the omnitool? Thanks.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_002_player_001">So... what&apos;s the project about?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_003_catherineomnitool_001">My project? Oh well, I saved all the people on the station as brain scans and put them into an artificial world. We were going to launch it into space, to save it from... uh, well, all this.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_004_player_001">Are you telling me that you were going to launch a computer world, filled with people, into space?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_005_catherineomnitool_001">Yes. It was just a pet project at first, but it got really serious after the comet took out the surface. Then suddenly it became very important and it was officially named the ARK.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_006_player_001">That&apos;s appropriate. How far did you get?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_007_catherineomnitool_001">I don&apos;t know. That version of me, that I am, it came from a scan I did pretty early on. The living Catherine could very well have finished the project and launched it. I guess she could even still be alive. Weird thought.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_008_player_001">So the talking robots, are they also scans you did?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_009_catherineomnitool_001">They could be, but I doubt it. I&apos;d expect much more sense if that was the case. Ah, all right. Finally.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_010_player_001">What&apos;s happening?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_011_catherineomnitool_001">I managed to restore some data from the back-up server. This should tell us everything we need.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_011_catherineomnitool_002">Oh... could you do me a favor and run into the other room and have a look? I don&apos;t seem to be able to view the files in this condition. I need to know that the ARK is safe.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_012_player_001">Sure, Cath.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_wakeupinomnitool_013_catherineomnitool_001">Thanks. I&apos;ll unlock the door for you.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_1_001_catherineomnitool_001">What was it you said before -- you&apos;re from Toronto?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_1_002_player_001">Yeah, I just went in for a brain scan and suddenly -- here I am.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_1_003_catherineomnitool_001">That&apos;s doesn&apos;t make any sense. How... why would anyone bring a scan from Toronto?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_1_004_player_001">You think that&apos;s strange? What if I tell you it was back in 2015?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_1_005_player_001">Woah.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_2_001_catherineomnitool_001">Can&apos;t make any sense of it.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_2_002_player_001">Did you say something?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_2_003_catherineomnitool_001">Sorry, still trying to figure out how you got here.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_2_004_player_001">Keep at it. I&apos;d really like to know who thought sending a Canadian to the bottom of the sea was a good idea.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_3_001_player_001">What happened before? That creature was strangely... overbearing.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_3_002_catherineomnitool_001">Yeah, it basically exploded with electromagnetism.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_3_003_player_001">That&apos;s bad for us, right?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_3_004_catherineomnitool_001">Confusing, at least. Gives the senses a good punch.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_4_001_catherineomnitool_001">What happened to the tower? And the dock, and the welcome center?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_4_002_player_001">What tower? What are you talking about?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_4_003_catherineomnitool_001">This place is in ruins. All the cameras show static. It&apos;s... it&apos;s so strange.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_5_001_player_001">Catherine?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_5_002_catherineomnitool_001">What?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_banterwithsimon_5_003_player_001">Nothing. Never mind.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_leavecloudandfoundnoark_1_001_catherineomnitool_001">See if you can find out where the ARK is.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_trackingdone_1_001_player_001">I found it. It&apos;s at a site named Tau.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_trackingdone_1_002_catherineomnitool_001">Oh, no. It&apos;s on earth! And so close to Phi -- they almost made it.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_trackingdone_1_002_catherineomnitool_002">Dammit. It won&apos;t make it for long in that state -- a couple of decades at most. That&apos;s not much to build a future.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_trackingdone_1_003_player_001">If we got to it. Could we get on the ARK?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_3_cath_trackingdone_1_004_catherineomnitool_001">I suppose, but I&apos;m not exactly flexible at the moment.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_backtogetomnitool_1_001_player_001">I&apos;ll take us there. I can move, jump, swim -- sort of. You&apos;re stuck in the door opener -- the omnitool. I&apos;ll just carry you there and you&apos;ll show me what to do.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_backtogetomnitool_1_002_catherineomnitool_001">That&apos;s sounds really risky -- besides I don&apos;t like the idea of you carrying me around.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_backtogetomnitool_1_003_player_001">Come on, Catherine. This is what you wanted to do. Your final mission. Let&apos;s launch the ARK!</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_backtogetomnitool_1_004_catherineomnitool_001">We would need to find a way to get into the abyss -- can&apos;t take the climber without a Power Suit. </Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_backtogetomnitool_1_004_catherineomnitool_002">We&apos;d probably have to go to Theta and pray the DUNBAT&apos;s still working.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_backtogetomnitool_1_005_player_001">Ok, so we go to Theta.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_backtogetomnitool_1_006_catherineomnitool_001">I don&apos;t know, it&apos;s pretty far.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_backtogetomnitool_1_007_player_001">Catherine, look around. What else is there to do?</Entry>

        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_putintolifeboat_1_002_player_001">I hear you. Can you get this thing running?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_putintolifeboat_1_003_catherineomnitool_001">Hang on, I&apos;ll give it a try.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_putintolifeboat_2_001_catherineomnitool_001">Sorry, it&apos;s dead.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_putintolifeboat_2_002_player_001">Worth a shot.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_putintolifeboat_2_003_catherineomnitool_001">This EV came from CURIE. It was a ship that used to make runs between Lambda and Lisbon. Looks like the wreck is close. Maybe you can find a vessel like this one inside?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_putintolifeboat_2_004_player_001">Sounds like a plan.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_4_cath_putintolifeboat_2_005_catherineomnitool_001">I&apos;ll just save the security information and update the omnitool. There -- should help you get around.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_remindofomnitool_001_catherinerobot_001">Just plug it into the terminal.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="cathandsimon_2_cath_remindofomnitool_006_catherinerobot_001">Ok. Simon. You know that tool you&apos;re carrying. It will fit perfectly in the terminal right over there.</Entry>
