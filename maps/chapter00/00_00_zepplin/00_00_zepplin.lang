        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_2_002_strasky_001">Uh, I hear you, Terry. I mean Mr. Akers, sir.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_2_003_akers_001">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I would like to come to Theta. Let Delta sleep.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_2_004_strasky_001">Of course! Wow, honestly didn&apos;t expect to hear from you again. Such a long time since you checked in.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_2_004_strasky_002">We have a few divers in a zeppelin surveying Lambda at moment. I&apos;ll just make sure they pick you up when they&apos;re done.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_2_005_akers_001">Ah, thank you for the warning. I&apos;ll make sure they feel welcome.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_2_006_strasky_001">Ok, see you when you get here.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_1_001_wan_001">Strasky? We can see the zeppelin now.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_1_002_strasky_001">Good. Sorry about the mess. Without the positioning system, the zepps just keep losing their set routes.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_1_002_strasky_002">Wolchezk did say that you could have fixed it on your side by re-jigging the antenna.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_1_002_strasky_003">Guess it doesn&apos;t matter now. Are all of you coming?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_1_003_wan_001">No, just me, Goya, and Krier. Akers is set on being a stubborn old man.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="recording_7_zeppelintransmission_1_004_strasky_001">All right. See you soon, Brandon. Happy evac!</Entry>
        <Entry Name="datamine_2_dataminemaggie_003_maggie_001">Come in, Strasky. Can you hear me?</Entry>

        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_005_catherine_001">Oh, right. Of course. Is this a zeppelin?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_006_player_001">Appropriately named. You think it can get us to Theta?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_007_catherine_001">It&apos;s a cargo transport. They use them for moving materials between the sites. Anything that&apos;s too big for the shuttles. I&apos;m sure it can carry us.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_008_catherine_001">Agh, why won&apos;t it work? Come on -- oh, the tool chip is bust.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_011_player_001">I had to deal with that back at Upsilon.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_012_catherine_001">Then you know how it works. We need to get a new tool chip and switch it.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_013_player_001">Care to point me in the direction of the closest tool chip storage?</Entry>

        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_015_player_001">What? Just knock a robot over the head and steal their chips?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_016_catherine_001">The toolbox over there says it has a stun baton. You could use that.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_017_player_001">Come on, I don&apos;t want to hurt anyone -- isn&apos;t this a bit much?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_018_catherine_001">It&apos;s just a robot, Simon.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_019_player_001">We&apos;re just robots!</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_insertcatherineonplatform_019_player_002">Sort of.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="dialog_8_fixcatherine_start_002_player_001">Could you do it? Kill a robot like that?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_fixcatherine_start_003_catherine_001">I get attached to them too, I&apos;m not a monster. But in this case it had to be done.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="dialog_8_pushycatherine_1_002_catherine_001">The robots only appear intelligent. They&apos;re much more like dogs than humans.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_8_pushycatherine_1_003_player_001">I wouldn&apos;t hit a dog!</Entry>
