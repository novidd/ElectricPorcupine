        <Entry Name="comment_2_leftairlockcomment_002_player_001">Well, Catherine, we found Theta.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_incorrectscanupload_001_catherine_001">No, won&apos;t work. We need someone from Theta Security Group.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_incorrectscanupload_002_catherine_001">That one won&apos;t work either. Look for security people like Cronstedt or Strohmeier.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_incorrectscanupload_003_catherine_001">No, I don&apos;t think so. Strohmeier recruited people from the evacuated sites. They should also know the cipher, if you can find one of them.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_incorrectscanupload_004_catherine_001">Okay, try actually reading the info and then pick one.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="dialog_3_correctscantraitexport_1_001_catherine_001">Very promising. I&apos;ll just load him up and get the simulator going.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_scanuploadexplanation_001_catherine_001">There should be a list of people. See if there&apos;s anyone who could know a security cipher.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_foundunburntchip_001_catherine_001">An intact memory chip. If we&apos;re lucky, we might be able to extract the cipher from it.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_1_001_wan_001">That wasn&apos;t so bad. Strohmeier really got me worked up. Bastard.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alicescanroom_1_001_wan_001">That wasn&apos;t so bad. Strohmeier really got me worked up. Bastard.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alicescanroom_1_002_alice_001">Well, that&apos;s what you get for listening to his stories.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alicescanroom_1_003_wan_001">Guess I had it coming.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alicescanroom_1_004_alice_001">About Strohmeier. He said he needed the new cipher asap. What should I tell him?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alicescanroom_1_005_wan_001">That&apos;s all right. I can talk to him.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alicescanroom_1_006_alice_001">Wait, didn&apos;t Chun just tell you to take it easy? Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m not going to tell anyone.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alicescanroom_1_007_wan_001">I do feel hung over. Okay, it&apos;s 1729 over 42, 12 over 407. Got it?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_alicescanroomdone_1_001_catherine_001">That&apos;s enough, we got what we need.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_cathunlocksbrandonsdoor_001_catherine_001">Here we go, Brandon Wan&apos;s room. I&apos;ll just override the lock for you.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_inbrandonsroomnofailedsimulation_001_catherine_001">Have a look around. Maybe he has something we can use to get the cipher.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_inbrandonsroomfailedsimulation_001_catherine_001">If we get to know him, maybe we can make the simulation a little smoother.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_lookatbrandonsbadge_001_catherine_001">He&apos;s a construct wrangler. He must know the cipher.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_readloveletter_001_player_001">There&apos;s a note from Alice that makes me think she was scanned alongside Brandon.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_readloveletter_002_catherine_001">Ok, that sounds really promising. We can definitely use that.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_afterdataminingintercom_001_player_001">I think I just heard Alice talking to Brandon on the intercom. Seems like they were getting ready to leave.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_afterdataminingintercom_002_catherine_001">You got that from the intercom? Must be a transmission buffer. Hang on.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_afterdataminingintercom_002_catherine_002">Great, this is exactly what we need!</Entry>
        <Entry Name="datamining_3_intercomdatamining_002_alice_001">Brandon, you ready to go? Strohmeier says it&apos;s time to move.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="datamining_3_intercomdatamining_003_wan_001">I&apos;m waiting for Strasky and Alvaro to pack up their stuff. Head downstairs and I&apos;ll meet you there.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="datamining_3_intercomdatamining_004_alice_001">Don&apos;t take too long.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="datamining_3_intercomdatamining_005_wan_001">Don&apos;t worry. We&apos;re right behind you.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_allbrandoncluesfound_001_catherine_001">I think we got this, Simon. I can synthesize Alice&apos;s voice from the intercom and use it to impersonate her for the simulation.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_allbrandoncluesfound_001_catherine_002">We can trick him into feeling safe enough to open up.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_allbrandoncluesfound_002_player_001">Great. Definitely feeling good about this.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_allbrandoncluesfound_003_catherine_001">Good job with the intercom. I didn&apos;t know you could datamine. What&apos;s it like?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_allbrandoncluesfound_004_player_001">It&apos;s just something that I do now.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_allbrandoncluesfound_005_catherine_001">So it comes naturally to you. That&apos;s really interesting.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="dialog_3_allbrandoncluesfound_006_player_001">Yeah, I&apos;ll make sure to add it to my dating profile.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_2_001_catherine_001">Mr Wan. Can you hear me?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_2_002_catherine_001">Congratulations, Mr Wan. The scan was successful.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_2_003_catherine_001">The scan is done. Are you feeling all right, Mr Wan?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_3_001_wan_001">Chun? Where&apos;s Alice?</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_4_001_catherine_001">She had to leave. Listen. I really need to know the new security cipher.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_4_002_catherine_001">She left. Mr Wan, I need you to give me the new security cipher.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_4_003_catherine_001">She&apos;s fine. We don&apos;t have much time, Mr Wan. I need the new security cipher.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_5_001_wan_001">What, why? Why would you need that? This is a trick!</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_6_001_catherine_001">Please, this is important.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_6_002_catherine_001">No, it&apos;s okay. I promise.</Entry>

        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_7_001_wan_001">I knew you couldn&apos;t be trusted -- none of this is real.</Entry>
        <Entry Name="simulation_3_alonescanroom_7_001_wan_002">You won&apos;t break me, WAU. You hear me, you won&apos;t break me!</Entry>
