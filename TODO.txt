-Have a sticky note say, "don't you fucking dare" on it

-Use the voice lines of the guy that screams for his life when he is being tortured because the power is off.

-Use the recorder for some voice lines.

-Reuse the stun weapon somehow. Maybe to recharge things with power, use them one the WAU healingstations?

-Reuse the coms and telephone, there is also a radio to use.

A hub room with a large window wall looking into the ocean, (Dead Space + Alien Isolation for insperation). 
In the middle of this room-toward the window-a two staircases meet from left and right leading down below the large window.
There is a tiny control room here with several terminals the player can control + datapad. There is a window here too (dunbat chassis for inspiration).
This is going to have to be built very much manually by hand with smaller assets (Use theta?).


- Add so the player can toggle the crosshair in the main menu (only affects the white dot, all other icons remain in effect).
- Add toggle view bob too.


Upload mod to ModDB and Steam Workshop.

THE STORY:

"(I've found) A place where I can be without remorse."

-The protagonist is the fellow (Brandon?) that Simon and Catherine used in the simulations. The idea is after the simulation his copy is still 'alive'.


-The game starts in the chair. After his copy gets left behind in the simulation, there is only silence.
-The player will eventually be able to move.

-You use the terminal behind - the terminal in the original game where you can access the copies (where you find Simon's copy).
-You look at some entries, there is a "reset systems" button.
-When the player clicks on it.

-The protagonist has a kid in this parallel universe missing a while a go (he has turned into a monster).
His notes will be in the computers and such. Make it emotional, and heartbreaking. 
The player will eventually find *His girlfriend (she is in the simulation scene)* as a monster, he touches her cheek--end.

-Establish as early as possible that his son is gone, use a picture maybe?
-His son is underground through a scholarship because of his potential, raw ability and academic achievements.
-Make the protagonist express his thoughts on that his son could've stayed on the surface and possibly died a less painful death and died with his mother and sister.
"Then I wouldn't had to live through that pain." (Rather selfish) The WAU records the players dialogue and uses it against him later.

/////////////////////////////////////////
// INTRO

-The protagonist starts with sitting in the chair which is an exact replica of the room used in the simulation in the original game.
-Simon and Catherine speak to the protagonist, he gets mad (reuse the voice lines).

STORY TEXT:

HERE REUSE WORDS FROM MARK SARANGS'S SUICIDE LETTER.

A place where I can be without remorse.

-The reboot 'accept' button shows up.

-When the player clicks on it, a loading bar shows and loads slowly (computer whirrs when loading).
-A wall has appeared behind you, you can't leave.
-It gets stuck (the sound of the computer freezes like in windows like a blue screen). 
-Screen breaks.
-The power shuts down (fade screen out when darkness is reached)
(add effects and music).
-Teleport the player in the darkness. Silence for some times. Creeping sound effects fade in.
-The player will move around. Randomally fade the screen in (disable black plane entity).
-The player can see refractions from a distance (depth of field makes it blurrier).
-Player approaches, *his wife's voice call out to him* it get's brighter and brighter (have a lensflare coming from the portal).
-Pieces of floor whoosh in front of the player.
-The beeping from a hospital looping, then baby cry, then baby laughter and so on (his parallel life is flashing before him).
-Objects from the parallel world float and refract in the air as if passing through a portal (underwater?).

////////////////////////////////////////
// ENDING

-THE FINAL ROOM IN THE GAME IS A HALL WITH THE ARK PLACED IN THE MIDDLE ON A PLATOFORM. WAU TENTACLES ATTACHED TO IT.
-THERE IS A TERMINAL BEHIND IT, CATHERINE'S BODY IS BESIDE THIS TERMINAL. 
-THE PLAYER HAS THE CHOICE TO DESTROY THE ARK OR LET IT CONTINUE. ON THIS TERMINAL THERE ARE RETAINED VOICE RECORDINGS,
THESE RECORDINGS ARE OF SIMON AND CATHERINE SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER (THE DIALOGUE BEFORE CHOOSING TO DELETING THE DATA OF BRANDON OR NOT).

-THERE IS A B-PLOT CHARACTER THAT ARGUES THAT IT'S BETTER FOR THE ARK TO STAY ON EARTH SUPPORTED BY THE WAU THAN TO FLOAT THROUGH SPACE.

WHEN THE GAME ENDS-BEFORE THE CREDITS-THE PLAYER IS IN THE SCAN ROOM AGAIN, BRANDON GETS UPSET WHEN TALKING TO CATHERINE, THEN DARKNESS. 
ROLL CREDITS.

-Early on find person dead with a datapad/computer? beside them.
"Don't jinx it."
"Good one. I do forget that people used to be superstitious."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Play of a this in notes and such from a Brandon from the new parallel universe how he has heard conversations between him and Alice that he
knows he's never had and that the feelings between them felt different--as if a wall were between them. 

"I felt a discrepancy--I had no ring on my finger followed by a feeling, a feeling which was distinctly familiar.
Akin to the electrifying feeling when a comb with a negative charge comes into contact with its respective charge of the hair on your head--a zap, an exchange of energy.
It's strange, such a tiny object can have such a strong of an effect on your senses. Simply facinating.

A great thought question comes into mind with all of this. Who the hell is "this" Brandon Wan?"

-The player will later find their own room, here is where the player will find out about the child in this parallel universe.
