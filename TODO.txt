// STORY:
// LOCATION: A space station
// PROTAGONIST: Simon (this is in another timeline)
		
// Use silence a lot (Think the feeling of the back rooms, even The Stanly Parable)
// What makes source maps so creepy?
		
// Eventually Simon will realize that he's not human, he looks at his hands as they flicker from human to robot
		
// 1. The game starts with Simon living his normal life in Toronto (it's not real obviously)
// It's exactly the same as the original game
// A camera flash and sound plays as Simon stands in front of the bathroom mirror drinking the medicine (the medicine always spawns here)
		
// 2. You take the train
// 3. Do the scan
// Simon is reminded that he needs to do the survey on his computer
// There is a survelliance room on the other side of the bathroom window (one-way window).
// 4. Instead of you teleporting to Upsilon you simply continue as if nothing went wrong
// 5. EVENING: Sleep at home
// Simon is feeling drowsy
		
// 7. NIGHTTIME: Simon wakes up in his apartment from a dog barking
// Simon gets a headache - you need to take some medicine
// You cannot turn on the lightswitches 

///////////////////////////
//APARTMENT ADDITIONS:

	// Play 00_06_lab/amb/spot/car_drive_louder after wake up

	// Turn off all the extra ambience sounds when entering the corridor - Think Stanly Parable
		
// 8. Simon can do a survey on his laptop (make the questions strange and oddly creepy and specific)
		
// 9. The doorbell rings
// You try to open the front door, it falls straight down
// Simon emotes "What?" "Hello, anybody there?"
		
// 8. In Simons dreams he is locked up in a interrogiation room, strapped to a chair, forced to answer questions on a screen
// "Please momentarily, the [UserNotFound] will be with you shortly."
// A pop up shows: "A failure to send a http request might require to "
// "Restart?" (only one option to click yes shows up)
// A cigarette on the table, with smoke rising
		
// The room looks like its in Toronto during 2016
// On the other end of the window is Brendan dead with his throat slit and a final message
// He locked himself in (on the other end of the door is another corpse, blood is on the door from banging)
		
// The thing is the people behind these experiments are all dead
// Catherine lead this investigation (elude to this in the room on the other side of the window)
		
// 9. The survey screen glitches out - !THE WAU!
		
// 10. The player finds a way out by breaking the wall
// 11. Pass through the maintenance path - lots of steam (have a scare here)
		
// 12. The player find lots of corpses and blood
		
// X. A lab that lots of general data, brain scans and analyzed data on Simons behavior
// Have notes about this
		
// ENDING.
		
// The player will find this recording eventually of david and simon after the scan: recording_5_simonrecording_1_001_david_001
		
// After you escape you will find these locations like movie sets or copies
// You find notes and stuff eluding to how they've tried to make it as accurate as possible - 
// Catherine is convinced that something must be missing and she tells them to find the missing detail, the others dissagree (conflict)
		
// The player can interact with terminals that control a scene - like sending a notification to Simons laptop, or making the train seem like its moving (the handles shaking and stuff + sound)
		
// The other humans are stage props too (interact with the terminal to reenact the old guy entering the subway - this can only be done once~)
		
// - Simons room - this window is glitching out
// - The lab
// - The inside of the train - Use Announcer_StationOsgoode_001_Announcer_001, Announcer_StationQueensPark_001_Announcer_001, Announcer_StationStAndrew_001_Announcer_001, Announcer_StationStPatrick_001_Announcer_001
// Run these announcer sounds on a loop - the room is dark lights flicker, the player can hear this sound from afar
		
// Creepy~~
		
// Have windows that simulate the different views (Toronto, and othe scenery)
// Sometimes the screen glitches
// The player can pull one of them off and behind it opens the rest of the station
