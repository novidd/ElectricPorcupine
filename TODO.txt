-Have a sticky note say, "don't you fucking dare" on it

-Use the voice lines of the guy that screams for his life when he is being tortured because the power is off.

-Use the recorder for some voice lines.

-Reuse the stun weapon somehow. Maybe to recharge things with power, use them one the WAU healingstations?

-Reuse the coms and telephone, there is also a radio to use.

A hub room with a large window wall looking into the ocean, (Dead Space + Alien Isolation for insperation). 
In the middle of this room-toward the window-a two staircases meet from left and right leading down below the large window.
There is a tiny control room here with several terminals the player can control + datapad. There is a window here too (dunbat chassis for inspiration).
This is going to have to be built very much manually by hand with smaller assets (Use theta?).


- Add so the player can toggle the crosshair in the main menu (only affects the white dot, all other icons remain in effect).
- Add toggle view bob too.

THE STORY:

"(I've found) A place where I can be without remorse."

-The protagonist is the fellow (Mark?) that Simon and Catherine used in the simulations. The idea is after the simulation his copy is still 'alive'.


-The game starts in the chair. After his copy gets left behind in the simulation, there is only silence.
-The player will eventually be able to move.

-You use the terminal behind - the terminal in the original game where you can access the copies (where you find Simon's copy).
-You look at some entries, there is a "reset systems" button.
-When the player clicks on it.

-The protagonist has a kid in this parallel universe missing a while a go (he has turned into a monster).
His notes will be in the computers and such. Make it emotional, and heartbreaking. 
The player will eventually find *His girlfriend (she is in the simulation scene)* as a monster, he touches her cheek--end.

-Establish as early as possible that his son is gone, use a picture maybe?
-His son is underground through a scholarship because of his potential, raw ability and academic achievements.
-Make the protagonist express his thoughts on that his son could've stayed on the surface and possibly died a less painful death and died with his mother and sister.
"Then I wouldn't had to live through that pain." (Rather selfish) The WAU records the players dialogue and uses it against him later.
