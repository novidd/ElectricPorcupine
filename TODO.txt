// STORY:
// LOCATION: A space station
// PROTAGONIST: Simon (this is in another timeline)

// MARKETING:
// - Everything I publish about the mod is like an advertisement for service.
// - Respond to all kinds of comments with an attitude of a Corperate Customer Support (short for CCS) with prewritten responses.
		
// - Use silence a lot (Think the feeling of the back rooms, even The Stanly Parable)
// - What makes source maps so creepy?
		
// - Eventually Simon will realize that he's not human, he looks at his hands as they flicker from human to robot

// Add dialogue with no Simon VO, like in visual novels

// THE PLAYERS MAIN GOAL: Find Catherine! (a parallel to the original game)
// - The player will never have a flashlight
// - This enables the datapad to be binded to "F" instead

// SCENES AND EVENTS:
// 1. The game starts with Simon living his normal life in Toronto (it's not real obviously)
// - It's exactly the same as the original game
// - A camera flash and sound plays as Simon stands in front of the bathroom mirror drinking the medicine (the medicine always spawns here)

(Ambitious)
// - Instead of the player just leaving through the level door the player will leave through the corridor instead, down the stairs and to the front entrance?
// - While walking in the corridor, a partly open door closes suddenly as the player approaches it.
// - A silhouette can be seen in the cracks before closing

// 2. - You take the train as usual
// - Change something here??

// 3. Do the scan
// - When in the scan room a commosion can be loudly heard from above.
// - Tiny screen shake
// - Dust falling from the ceiling
// - Video distortion? (glitch effect)
// - Do the controller rumble too 
// - Simon emotes
// - Heartbeat
// - Munshi ignores it and responses with a carefree response, OR clip existing dialogue to make it seem perfectly natural

// - There is a room above with a glass window floor

// 4. Wake up instantly in his apartment at night
// - Simon laying on his back looking at the ceiling - dizzy
// - Slow blinking
// - Heartbeat
// - Groaning
// - Sound of vomit crawling up (the drowning sfx?)
// - Speed up heartbeat
// - Close eyes (screen fade out)
// - Quick steps toward the toilet - wood: "player/footsteps/sneaker/small_room/wood_laminate", marble: "player/footsteps/sneaker/small_room/default_hard"
// - Sound of door handle being pulled
// - Door swinging in a hastly manner
// - !VOMIT! YAY!!
// - Place a particle on the camera animation
// - Fade in
// - Lower FoV
// - Mess around with Chromattic Abboration, DoF, Image trail, Radial Blur, Bloom, Sway
// - Do the controller rumble too
// - Fade out during vomiting
// - Fade in again after standing up
// - Reset FoV
// - Player is slower momentarily
// - Screen sway as if drunk
// - Sound if distant thunder
// - Simon falls, then wakes up suddenly (the rain has cleared, its early morning, the sound of morning birds)
// - When Simon falls on ground play: 02_06_theta_tunnels/sfx/events/elevator_sequence/ladder/ground_hit 

// - A new email from Munshi - match the writing style with his dialogue and his other email.
// EMAIL TEXT: "[MORE TEXT]. I expect to see you next week. Keep it up, and make sure to have a good nights sleep. If you have any complications contact me immediately so we can reconsider your future."
// - Simon comment: "*sigh* A hell of a night alright."
// - The player needs to pick up the smartphone and attempt to call Munshi, he wont respond. (look in the lab map code)

// - You cannot turn on the lightswitches for some reason - Simon comment

// 5. The corridor
// - The video distortion when the player finds the blood on the floor
// - Start looping 01_01_upsilon_awake/sfx/wake_up/nervous, just like in Upsilon (disable the sound during dialogue - use a bool)
// - Simon commments - "What the hell? Hello?"
// - Find the body, Simon calls 911 no one answers
// - After Simon finds the keypad code the puppet spawns from the vent
// - Use this sound for the vent breaking: 03_02_omicron_inside/SFX/vent_hatch_rip THIS TOO: 02_05_theta/sweeteners/akers_tomfoolery/akers_server_spawn
// Turn off static physics for the vent to get the sound of the vent falling on the floor (or play it manually for more control)
// - The player has to hide under tables and such
// - The puppet will FIRST enter the archive room and then the server room - this is the players window to sneak past to enter the code
// - CODE SUCCESS! - ESCAPE! YAY!
// - On code success alert the puppet - the player has to hurry to close the door (it locks automatically)
// - The puppet smashes the door - 02_06_theta_tunnels/sfx/events/elevator_sequence/akers_attack
// - Play dust particles on smash (Upsilon door smash event?)
// - Load next map in maintenance tunnel
// MAP END

// X. The player will find an unfinished survey questionare - at the last question the program crashes or something "Exception on line[...]"

// X. In the maintenance tunnel
// - Play 02_05_theta/sweeteners/akers_tomfoolery/akers_distant 
// - The player fill find a safe space where the blood guy dropped his datapad
// - Play special music when the player picks it up
// - Find notes mentioning a "Catherine", and that she is behind alot of what's going on
// - The computer/datapad does an AI text reconstruction of the conversation and identifies the speakers

// - The reconstruction:
// "Indentified speaker, 'Chun Catherine' and '[ANOTHER CHARACTER]'."

// - "God damn't it, Catherine! What the hell did you do? First the ARK, now this?"
// - *silence*
// - *whisper* "Why is it never enough for you...?"
// - *silence*
// - ""

// X. The movie sets
// - The player drops down
// - First establish longterm objective (FIND CATHERINE)
// X. The player finds a conversation between Simon and Catherine
// - Simon reacts - "What the hell? How is this possible?"

// - Then establish map objective
// - A locked path - omnitool needed?
// - The player needs to find the omnitool to proceed

// - Give the player some down time before the puppet comes back - some story telling and world building, environmental storytelling and such

// - The player can hear this behind the section divider door: 02_05_theta/sweeteners/akers_tomfoolery/akers_closed_corridor_door

// - The power goes out
// - The puppet breaks down the door that blocked to only path to the area where the key to the objective is located
// - The puppet arrives and patrols the area
// - The player has to sneak around the puppet until they clear this area

// - The player passes a puddle with a wire in it - foreshadowing
// - The player finds a monitor showing the current status of all people in this area - One person is still alive
// - The player pulls the power switch (to turn the power back on), they can hear distant screaming which kills this exact same person - the player finds their body fried smoke rising from their toasted body on the ground
// - When turning on the power on level 2 use level_amb_shared_machines/misc/industrial_lights/breaker_small_on_distant OR level_amb_shared_machines/misc/industrial_lights/breaker_small_on
// - Simon comment - "Oh, oh... what the fuck!"
// - You pick up the Omnitool from their body - !GUILT ACTIVATED! MWAHAHAHAHA!
// - You can hear a near silent breathing from him
// - puppet_dreamer_male.ent for his body and lower the colormul to: 0A0A0AFF, OR use another body
// Run the code Entity_PlayAnimation("[CHARACTER NAME]_toasted", "puppet_victim_lying", 0, true, true); for him to lie on his back breathing heavily

// - The player can find this guys safe room
// - There are notes and stuff about this guy and his friend (the guy dead in the archives room)

// - The puppet is attracted to the sound 
// - Activate the final chase to the end of map

// - After this the chase scene - in a safe space (an airlock - switch map here)
// MAP END

// X. [The final area] Objective: Find Catherine!
// - After the airlock reveal the fact the player is in space (drop tiny breadcrumbs telling the player this earlier)
// - The distant sound of a presentation (the tunnel phatos infomershal OR the omnitool introduction infomershal)
// - The player needs an omnitool securty chip
// - You need to find the administrator's body (take his security chip) - Brandon theta slut throat body
// - Use a tracking terminal like when you track the ARK in (delta? omicron?)
// - Reuse the some voice files (the ARK survey in delta - copy whole termal code)

// - The sound of distant mice in the lab - level_amb_shared_interior/amb/spot/animals/mice
// - Open rat testing cages 

// X. Find Catherine's body
// - She's got something in her hand - an tool item for the player to pick up (it gives the player a ticket to upload themselves to the ark)
// - And a recording of Simon and Catherine's conversation on the Zeppelin to Theta
// - Show a picture of Catherine on the terminal just like old times
// - "Eternity among the stars"

// TWO ENDINGS:
// - Give the player two choices:
// - For this to be enticing, I need to have to end screens for each choice.

// - 1: (GIGACHAD) Leave the station by taking the pod to earth to find surviving humans to attempt to help rebuild humanity and potentially live for eternity 
// - Show a trajectory map in the pod during the "flight" toward earth
//
// ENDING SCREEN:
// - Simon is holding a picture of Ashley and him (00_01_corkboard_foto.ent), as he is looking into the apocalyptic Sunset
// - Use all the different photos that Simon has taken before and put them nailed to a board
// ROLL CREDITS

// - 2: (BETA) Escape by scanning yourself to the ARK by sitting in the chair 
// - In a room connected to this room is a scan chair, you sit in it
// - Fade out.
// ENDING SCREEN:
// - Use cinematic shots with DoF - shots of swaying grass and close up of rocks and such (the sound of the beach in the background with the wind)
// - Close up shots of the boat (05_02_boat.ent) swaying in the water
// - Catherine's distant voice, maybe children squealing and laughing
// - Shot of the waves
// - Screen starts to glitch out
// - Use particles from levels/05_02 for the beach water waves, clouds, and fog.

// - The final shot from below (ground) looking up at grave - swaying grass (sun shining straight on)
// - Use the tombstone grave_marie.ent to encinuate that Simon is dead (place pictures on his grave, a bouqet of flowers, and Simon's camera)
// - Import rebirth assets perhaps?
// - "We made it Simon[...]" (The same line used when in space?)
// ROLL CREDITS

// IDEAS:
// - Entities_Special/Equipment/scanner/interface_scan_sequence for the sound when in the camera view
// - Place an aquarium somewhere (use particle oil_underwater_smoky.ps for leaking oil spill)
// - The player will later find Munshi's corpse.
// - (easter egg) an image of Munshi smiling (the meme) - "Recovering image file" in a terminal
// - The player needs to kill a person to proceed forward
// - The player pulls a power switch and it kills a person - the player finds their body fried on the ground

///////////////////////////
//APARTMENT ADDITIONS:

	// Play 00_06_lab/amb/spot/car_drive_louder after wake up
	// The clock on the wall ticks on the nighttime silence
	// No new messages - AnswerMachine_13_NoNewMessages_001_AnswerMachine_001
	// Cut the fridge interaction to "Nothing but fast food."
	// On microwave open/close turn on the light inside 
	// 1. Lick it.
	// 2. Don't lick it.
	// 3. Lick it, but only a little.
	
	// Turn off all the extra ambience sounds when entering the corridor - Think Stanly Parable
		
// 8. Simon can do a survey on his laptop (make the questions strange and oddly creepy and specific)
		
// 9. The doorbell rings
// You try to open the front door, it falls straight down
// Simon emotes "What?" "Hello, anybody there?"
		
// 8. In Simons dreams he is locked up in a interrogiation room, strapped to a chair, forced to answer questions on a screen
// "Please momentarily, the [UserNotFound] will be with you shortly."
// A pop up shows: "A failure to send a http request might require to "
// "Restart?" (only one option to click yes shows up)
// A cigarette on the table, with smoke rising
		
// The room looks like its in Toronto during 2016
// On the other end of the window is Brendan dead with his throat slit and a final message
// He locked himself in (on the other end of the door is another corpse, blood is on the door from banging)
		
// The thing is the people behind these experiments are all dead
// Catherine lead this investigation (elude to this in the room on the other side of the window)
		
// 9. The survey screen glitches out - !THE WAU!

// Have notes about this
		
// ENDING.
		
// The player will find this recording eventually of david and simon after the scan: recording_5_simonrecording_1_001_david_001
		
// After you escape you will find these locations like movie sets or copies
// You find notes and stuff eluding to how they've tried to make it as accurate as possible - 
// Catherine is convinced that something must be missing and she tells them to find the missing detail, the others dissagree (conflict)
		
// The player can interact with terminals that control a scene - like sending a notification to Simons laptop, or making the train seem like its moving (the handles shaking and stuff + sound)
		
// The other humans are stage props too (interact with the terminal to reenact the old guy entering the subway - this can only be done once~)
		
// - Simons room - this window is glitching out
// - The lab
// - The inside of the train - Use Announcer_StationOsgoode_001_Announcer_001, Announcer_StationQueensPark_001_Announcer_001, Announcer_StationStAndrew_001_Announcer_001, Announcer_StationStPatrick_001_Announcer_001
// Run these announcer sounds on a loop - the room is dark lights flicker, the player can hear this sound from afar
		
// Creepy~~
		
// Have windows that simulate the different views (Toronto, and othe scenery)
// Sometimes the screen glitches
// The player can pull one of them off and behind it opens the rest of the station
