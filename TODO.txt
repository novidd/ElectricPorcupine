Blue light billboards along the sides and above the bridge, simulating the sunlight from above the ocean.

Interface/gameplay/progression_hit when progressing

A hub room with a large window wall looking into the ocean, (Dead Space + Alien Isolation for insperation). 
In the middle of this room-toward the window-a two staircases meet from left and right leading down below the large window.
There is a tiny control room here with several terminals the player can control + datapad. There is a window here too (dunbat chassis for inspiration).
This is going to have to be built very much manually by hand with smaller assets (Use theta?).

THE STORY:

-They arrived through a large uboat/ship. The intro sequence is where this is located.

-The protagonist's kid has gone missing a while a go (he has turned into a monster).
His notes will be in the computers and such. Make it emotional, and heartbreaking. 
The player will eventually find the kid as a monster, he touches his cheek--end.

-Establish as early as possible that his son is gone, use a picture maybe?
-His son is underground through a scholarship because of his potential, raw ability and academic achievements.
-Make the protagonist express his thoughts on that his son could've stayed on the surface and possibly died a less painful death and died with his mother and sister.
"Then I wouldn't had to live through that pain." (Rather selfish) The WAU records the players dialogue and uses it against him later.

// THE CHESS PUZZLE

-Copy the chess gui from delta.

-A terminal with chess somewhere.
-The chessboard is setup so the WAU does the first move.
-It always wins no matter what move the player does for their first move. The player cannot win against the WAU. It then resets on a loop.

-When they've done this, the chess game is winnable.
-A new prompt shows up that the last session was restored.

-When the player fails with the finishing move, the program throws an error and says its corrupted. 
It restarts from the same cached session in loop till the player wins.

/////////////////////////////////////////
// THE BRIDGE

-The player will cross the bridge on railway with some sort of transport vehicle.
-The vehicle will have a terminal on it. It scans for nearby networks. Each end of the bridge has one (+ the middle).
	- Have a spinning thing when it searches (don't connect immediately, have delay of ~2-5s (yellow connecting status)).
	- Set current network depending on the transport vechile's location. Use areas, set on collision (Use 1 handler for this).
	- Each one of these networks give the terminal unique functionality.
	- When the player reaches the middle part of the bridge, it's network is inactive. The player needs to activate it (show on terminal).

--THE PEACEFUL HOME BASE--

-When in base use human hands.

"After some point in time, the unending water leaking into the dome became as comforting as a fan blowing in the summer heat -- cooling my skin."

-There are pictures on the walls.
-Old research notes.
-Calculations.
-A Terminal.
-The player has to place the item and it's container in a fridge for safe keeping.

-After a certain amount of time the player gets a transmission from somewhere.
-This is the inciting incident!!
